Next step is to run code from rylevs to gather all the data until we see tetris
screen. then run our code until the endless loop occurs and compare outputs.

we could use python to process the logs to remove lines that are the same. for
that to work properly we need fix the output of both software to show same data
TODO:
* get tetris to boot
* sound
* control input
